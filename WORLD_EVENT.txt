1. Event is triggered every second mouse click.
2. The event is a lightning strike. The lightning strike creates a new entity at the click point,
   then sets grass and dirt background objects to static terrain in an X pattern from the origin.
   Static terrain is just different in appearance and is traversable.
   Raindrop entities are created two squares away from the origin in each direction.
   The nearest blob to the origin absorbs all the energy from the lightning strike and turns into an electro blob.
3. Electro blobs need to dump their limitless energy, so they attack blacksmiths. Blacksmiths turn into Friedsmiths,
   which is short for fried blacksmith.
4. The new entity is essentially a hunter. To hunt the electro blobs, it goes to the nearest Friedsmith, where it
   retrieves the energy dumped there by the electro blob and then uses it to kill the nearest electroblob using magic.
   It then restores the Friedsmith to a normal Blacksmith so the miners can continue with their labor.
